Unsupervised learning is a technique of teaching our computer to learn from a data without a label. Meaning the data doesn't have any data to learn from.
Unsupervised learning is used to find patterns in the data. The most common unsupervised learning algorithms are clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Clustering is a technique of grouping similar data points together. The most common clustering algorithms are K-means and hierarchical clustering. The task of the clustering algorithm is to find the best way to group the data points together. The data comes with only input x and no output y.
